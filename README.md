<h1>Fall Detection for Elderly People Using LiDAR Sensor</h1>

<p><strong>Project Overview:</strong> This project presents a real-time fall detection system that utilizes LiDAR sensors to accurately classify human activities and identify potential falls among elderly people. The system achieved an accuracy of <strong>84%</strong> in Human Activity Classification, demonstrating the potential for supporting elderly care with prompt fall detection.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Real-time fall detection with an accuracy of 84%.</li>
    <li>Extensive dataset created using LiDAR sensors, featuring over 40+ diverse scenarios and simulated falls.</li>
    <li>Coordinated with a team of 9 to develop a supervised Deep Learning model specifically for fall detection using LiDAR sensor data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>System Overview</h2>
<p>This system leverages LiDAR sensors to capture and process real-time data, enabling accurate activity classification and fall detection. The robust dataset, developed through extensive simulation, enhances the model's reliability across a wide range of fall scenarios.</p>

<h2>Research Publication</h2>
<p>This work was published in the IEEE Journal as part of the paper titled "<strong>Fall Detection for Elderly People using LiDAR Sensor</strong>" and was presented at the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Internet of Things (AI-IoT) held at VIT, Vellore in 2024.</p>
